# RemindMe : Chrome Extension
###### Don't stress ur brain to memorize for upcoming events.

Event Reminder will be loaded automatically each time you open the extension.

The event reminders can be created in the same webpage and can be acessible to any other tabs also.

All events are stored by using the Chrome Storage API. There are some advantages with it like the automatically sync of your events between browsers, and some limitations with the data storage quota (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage#property-sync).
